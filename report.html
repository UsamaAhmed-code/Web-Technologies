    <h1>Summary</h1>
    <p>The Wikipeda aricle " Koumala, Queensland" is about the small place. In the Mackay Region of Queensland, Australia, there is a rural community called Koumala. Koumala's neighborhood has 831 residents as of the 2016 Census. The region encompassing Mount Funnel and Cape Palmerston is safeguarded in the east by Cape Palmerston National Park. The Hatfield Range, often referred to as the Koumala Range locally, is located to the west. Since the paved route over the Sarina range was wrecked by landslides that happened during Cyclone Debbie, a gravel road over this range offers an alternative route to the Sarina hinterland and was the only one accessible for a while. The word Koumala, which means "sweet potato" in Fijian, was first used to refer to the town's railroad station, which was named in 1914 after a sugar estate used by sugar planter and surveyor Alfred H. Burbank.</p>
