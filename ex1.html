    <h1>Nuclear Power Plant Control Panel Feedback</h1>

    <div class="exercise" id="exercise1">
        <div class="exercise-header"><h3>EXERCISE 1: Use of Color</h3></div>
        <div class="exercise-content">
           <div> <h3>Alarm Control</h3>
             <p>In the Alam cotrol panel, there are 3 buttons <b>Red</b>, <b>Amber</b>, and <b>Green</b> that show the state of alarm. The green button shows that everything is going normal. The Amber button will blienk when there is minor problem in the operations and red bitton is to represent the major problem. All three colors are universal standards, green as positive, amber as normal and red as danger.</p> 
             <p>The increzse and decrease button are of blue button. that are okay but I think there should be different colors for both as a new user can get confuse.   </p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h3>Emergency Shutdown</h3>
                <p>The Emergency shutdown panel has only one button. The Red color button for the immediate shutdownof the operations. The red color this the button is perfect as the it indiactes the danger and alert the user.</p>
            </div>

            <div>
                <h3>Emergency Confirm</h3>
                <p>In the Emergency confirm panel, there are two buttons one is cofrim button, and on=ther is cancel button. The confirm button is always steady green but it turns red wehn the conformation is needed. It is good to attaract the user user with red color for conformation. the cancel button is always green. I think, when both buttons will be green it may cause a misunderstanding for the user and for the color blind people. </p>

                <h3>Grouping</h3>
                <p>The functions are divided are sub panel in a logical way. All the state of alarm and the emergency control are on the pne side of the panel. The manual override panel and displsy is on the other side. There is a numeric keypad that will allow to user to qucikly enter the valuse and control the system </p>
                <h3>Sequences</h3>
                <p>The control panel and the manual override panel are on quite serpate distance one on most left and other is on most right. The Distance may cause  a extra time for the user in the emergency siutation. The display of the manual override panel should be on the top of the the keypad.</p>
